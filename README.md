# SimulatedAnnealing-BoxStacker
A Java-based solution for the NPC-style box stacking problem using Simulated Annealing. The program seeks to find the tallest possible stack of 3D boxes under strict geometric constraints, where each box can be rotated and used only once, and every box must strictly fit within the base of the one beneath it.
